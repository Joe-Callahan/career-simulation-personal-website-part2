          <p>
            As a Real Estate Broker, and frequent Zillow consumer, I believe there to be fundamental flaws in the way that Zillow operates. 
            I am going to set out on a mission to fix the issues that I see in Zillow's features and offerings by coding out new features into a clone website with features that I expect consumers to appreciate.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expectation is that this project will highlight a deep understanding of web development as well as an innante ability to communicate marketing and business features to potential employers.
            I want it to be apparent that I am providing more value to an employer than just the ability to code - but code creatively, proactively, and thoughtfully.

            A Sports Statistics Calculator</a></h3>

            A project that I will be doing for my own enjoyment - pairing my love of sports with my deep understanding of statistics, numbers, and calculations.
            I am going to set out to create a fun calculator for sports fans and participants. 
            This calculator will have the ability to calculate statistics by sport, then by category, with user inputs in a database format. I plan on starting with baseball statistics, then moving on to include golf, football, and basketball over time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this would be for non-professional sports leagues to keep track of statistics, a casual golfer to keep his handicap for free, etc. As a child, I was statistic-obsessed when I played sports.
            I would like to have different settings too, so people of all ages and abilities could use it to their desired detail level.

            A Family Finance App</a></h3>

          <p>
            As a former tax professional, I have found that it has gotten increasingly more difficult to manage family finances after purchasing a home, having kids, etc. 
            With each major milestone in life, managing finances seems to get more and more neglected until tax season comes around.
            The thought is to make some sort of manager/calculator/reminder app to intitiate particular events based on user inputs such as savings goals, fund allocations (vacation, house upgrades, schooling costs), etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is still very much in a brainstorming phase with so many different directions to go; however, it's something that I think would be very useful and I have the financial and organizational knowledge to make it work well.
